    "Let us say we need to find the roots of a complicated polynomial. Newton-Raphson method helps us to successively try and get better approximations to the roots (where $ f(x) = 0 $ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us have a look at figure 1 below. We take a random point $ f(x_0) $, then draw a tangent line through $ x_0 $ , $ f(x_0) $ , using the derivative $ f'(x_0) $ . The point $ x_1 $ where this tangent line crosses the x axis will become the next proposal we check.\n",

    "We calculate the tangent line at $ f'(x_1) $ to find $ x_2 $ and so on. In theory, our aim is to continue this process for $ |f(x_n)| \\to 0 $ . But in practice, this process might take too long for computers so we calculate the point really close to the zero. \n",

    "We can derive the formula below for $ x_{n+1} $ from definition of derivatives, for the next point's tangent crossing the $ x-axis $ .\n",
